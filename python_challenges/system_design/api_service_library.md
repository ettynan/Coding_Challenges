## Design an API Service for a Library
### Key Components:

- Book Catalog: A collection of books with metadata like title, author, availability status.
- User Management: Handles member registration, login, and permissions.
- Checkout System: Tracks which books are checked out by which users, due dates, and late fees.
- Search and Recommendation: Search functionality by book title, author, genre, etc., and recommendations based on user interests.
- Fine Management: Keeps track of fines for overdue books.

### Considerations:

- Search Efficiency: Implement fast search for users and administrators (indexing, caching).
- API Rate Limiting: Ensure the API can handle high volumes of queries without overloading the server.
- Data Consistency: Ensure books are not checked out by two users at the same time.

### Technologies:

- REST API for handling requests such as GET /books, POST /checkout, etc.
- Database: A relational database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) for storing books, users, and transactions.
- Search Indexing: Elasticsearch for quick text-based searches.
