## Implement a Cache Used by Multiple Threads
### Key Components:

- Cache: A key-value store that is thread-safe and can be accessed concurrently by multiple threads (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
- Thread Synchronization: Use locking mechanisms or atomic operations to ensure thread-safe interactions with the cache.
- Cache Expiration/Invalidation: Implement cache invalidation when data changes to ensure consistency.
### Considerations:

- Thread Safety: Ensure that simultaneous read/write operations from multiple threads are handled without data corruption.
- Concurrency Control: Implement mechanisms like read-write locks to ensure threads don't conflict.
### Technologies:

- Redis for multi-threaded applications.
- Java's Concurrent Collections or Pythonâ€™s threading library can help in managing thread synchronization.
