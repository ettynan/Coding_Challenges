## Design a Scalable API with Cache
### Key Components:

- API Gateway: Routes incoming requests to the appropriate service.
- Backend Services: Microservices that provide the data, which is cached for performance.
- Cache: A distributed cache (e.g., Redis) that stores frequently accessed data.
- Database: A persistent store for data, with cache serving as a performance-enhancing layer on top.

### Considerations:

- Scalability: Design APIs that can scale horizontally by splitting traffic between multiple backend services.
- Cache Management: Use cache to avoid hitting the database for frequently requested data.
- Data Consistency: Ensure that cache and database are in sync, using techniques like cache invalidation or background updates.

### Technologies:

- Microservices architecture to separate different API functionalities.
- API Rate Limiting to avoid overloading the services.
- Redis/Memcached for caching frequently requested data.
- Database: SQL or NoSQL depending on the data's consistency and query needs.
