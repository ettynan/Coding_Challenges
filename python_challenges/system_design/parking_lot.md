## Design a Parking Lot System
### Key Components:

- Parking Spaces: Represents available parking slots (can be categorized by type: compact, regular, handicapped).
- Vehicle Management: Tracks vehicles entering and exiting the parking lot, with details like license plates, parking time, etc.
- Payment System: Calculate parking fees based on time spent, with payment options (credit card, digital wallets).
- Entry/Exit System: Automated gates, license plate recognition or ticketing system.
- Space Allocation: A system to assign a parking spot when a vehicle enters the lot.
- Monitoring: Track available spots and real-time updates on space availability.

## Considerations:

- Scalability: Consider a large parking lot with many spots. Should the system handle millions of cars per day (e.g., an airport parking system)?
- Real-Time Availability: Quickly update parking space availability.
- Concurrency: Handle multiple cars trying to enter/exit at the same time.
- Cost and Billing: Accurate billing based on the time parked and ensuring payment is processed correctly.

## Technologies:

- Database: Use a relational database (SQL) to store vehicle, transaction, and space data.
- Queueing system for managing parking requests or space availability updates.
- Cloud computing for scalability and handling real-time requests.
